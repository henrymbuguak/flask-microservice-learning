# **User Management Microservice with Flask and SQLAlchemy**  

Welcome to the **User Management Microservice Tutorial Series**! This guide walks you through building a **production-ready microservice** using **Flask** and **SQLAlchemy**. Each part of the series focuses on a different aspect, from setting up the project to deploying it with Docker.  

---

## **1. Features**  
âœ… User registration and authentication with JWT  
âœ… Full CRUD operations for managing users  
âœ… Error handling and input validation  
âœ… Logging and monitoring  
âœ… Unit testing with `pytest`  
âœ… Containerization with Docker  

---

## **2. Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:  

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **pip (Python package manager)**  
- **Docker (optional for containerization)**  

---

## **3. Getting Started**  

### **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/henrymbuguak/flask-microservice-learning.git
cd flask-microservice-learning
```

### **Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Run the Application**  

```bash
cd user_management_microservice
python run.py
```

By default, the service runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.  

---

## **4. API Endpoints**  

### **Log in to Get a JWT Token**  
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "testpass"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/login
```

### **Fetch All Users**  
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>" http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/users
```

### **Fetch a Single User**  
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>" http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/users/1
```

### **Update a User**  
```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "updateduser"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/users/1
```

### **Delete a User**  
```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>" http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/users/1
```

---

## **5. Running with Docker**  

### **Build the Docker Image**  
```bash
docker build -t user_management_microservice .
```

### **Run the Container**  
```bash
docker run -p 8080:5000 user_management_microservice
```

Once running, access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.
